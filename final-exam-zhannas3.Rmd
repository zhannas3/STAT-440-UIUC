## Final Exam 
### Due: Tuesday May 10, 2022 11:59 pm US Central Time
#### Created by Christopher Kinson

Grading Rubric (per question):  
2 points if complete and correct  
1 point if incomplete or incorrect  
0 points if no attempt made  


**Retrieving your work**

This exam .Rmd file is written in Markdown. The .Rmd file can be rendered as an .html file for easier viewing and has been created to do so based on the YAML header at the top of this document. This and all future exams are located in the **exams** directory within the **stat440-sp22-course-content** repo, i.e. **stat440-sp22-course-content/exams** in GitHub. It is always recommended that you **pull** (or refresh) the **stat440-sp22-course-content** repo to ensure that you have the most updated version of all course content including the exam(s). After pulling (or refreshing) the **stat440-sp22-course-content** repo, the final exam file will be in the exams directory. Once you have opened the .Rmd file, you may begin writing your answers beneath each problem in the **Answer** section. Do not remove any of the original problems (nor top matter) from the file, because that makes it more difficult for the course staff to grade your assignment. 

**Submitting your work** 

In your individual student repo (named as your netID), you are to submit ***two*** files:

a. Your reproducible document file (.Rmd) which should be saved as final-exam-netID.Rmd. For example, my exam file would be saved as final-exam-kinson2.Rmd.

b. Your rendered reproducible document file (.html) which should be saved as final-exam-netID.html. For example, my exam file would be saved as final-exam-kinson2.html.

**Do not place your files in a sub-directory (or folder).** You have an unlimited number of submissions, but only the latest proper submission (commit and push) will be viewed and graded. **Remember the .Rmd file needs to render properly to .html before submitting.** 


***

### All students are expected to complete all problems.

### The following problems should be completed by you as an individual. If any problem asks you a particular question, be sure to answer it completely (with code, written sentences, or both). Written sentences should not appear in code chunks or code cells. Written sentences should appear in Markdown syntax unless specifically stated otherwise.

### Do not change anything in this file above the double line. Doing so will prevent your exam from being graded.

***
***

### Use the URLs to access the data (unless specified otherwise). No local files allowed. When a problem specifies to use SQL or SQL data management concepts, then SQL is required. Otherwise SQL is not required.

### Late submissions will not be accepted. Thus, a late submission of the final exam will result in a score of 0.

**#1** 

**Problem:** Using Markdown syntax, make a numbered list with your first and last name in normal text as the first item. As the second item, write your NetID in all lower case letters.

**Question:** what was your most memorable moment being in this class this semester? If there were none, why do you think that is?

**Answer:** 

The most memorable moment being in this class for me is learning a new programming language. Because I did not have a prior experience with R before.

**Problem:** Using Markdown syntax and at least two complete sentences, answer the following question(s).

**Question:** Would you take another course with this instructor? Explain your answer.

- Data Description for Popular Baby Names in US Data: The dataset (a .csv file) contains 658127 rows and 4 columns. The data is a combination of popular baby names by gender, frequency, and year from 2001 to 2020 in the US. The baby names come from Social Security records. Soon after a child is born in the US, the parent(s) file for a Social Security card. This data does not include baby names with frequencies less than 5. The original source is the Social Security Administration https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html.

```{r}
library(sqldf)
sqldf("SELECT *
      FROM baby 
      WHERE name == 'Obsidian' 
      ORDER BY freq DESC
      ")
```

**#14** 

**Problem:** Create a subset of the Popular Baby Names in US Data imported in **Problem 11** that only includes baby names within the range "We" - "Za" (where the endpoints are inclusive). Now, print a random sample of 10 rows from this subset. There should be 4 columns in the result. **"We" means names with "W" as the first letter and "e" as the second letter, such as "Weston". "Za" means names with "Z" as the first letter and "a" as the second letter. The range "We" - "Za" includes names such as "Weston", "Xiang", "Yury", and "Zavion." The range "We" - "Za" excludes names like "Wdando" and "Zbinee". The result must be random without setting any initial seed value and without specifying a random number generation state.**

**Answer:**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
We_Za<- baby[str_detect(baby$name,"^[W-W][e-z]|^[X-Y][a-z]|^[Z-Z][a-a]"),]
We_Za[sample(nrow(We_Za),10),]
```

**#15** 

**Problem:** Using the Popular Baby Names in US Data imported in **Problem 11**, create a new tibble (not a data frame) named "a_names" that does the following items (in this order):

- filters the observations such that the names begin with the letter "A" and the year equals 2001

- mutates a new column called "len" which equals the number of letters in each baby name

- mutates a new column called "overall_rank" which assigns the number 1 to the name with the highest frequency regardless of sex; **if there is a tie in frequency, then the name with the smallest "len" receives a lower number in the "overall_rank" column; if there is a tie in "len" then the name beginning with the earliest letter in the alphabet receives a lower number in the overall_rank" column; for example, if Chris, Kris, and Cris are tied in frequency, then the overall_rank" number in parentheses among these three names would be Cris (1), Kris (2), Chris (3).**

- arranges the data by "overall_rank" in ascending order

Now, print the first 10 observations of the "a_names" data set.

**Answer:**
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
a_names <- baby%>%
  filter(str_detect(baby$name, "^A"))%>%
  filter(year==2001)%>%
  mutate(len = str_count(name))%>%
  arrange(desc(freq),len,name)

a_names$overall_rank = 1:nrow(a_names)

a_names %>%
  arrange(overall_rank)

a_names <- as_tibble(a_names)
head(a_names, 10)
```

Your answer to the question should be written in a complete sentence(s) (in the **Answer** section) and must include executable code with a printed result as evidence of your answer.

**Question:** Are short women or tall women (height measured in centimeters) represented more in the data? Short is defined as at or below the 33th percentile in height (in centimeters). Tall is defined as at or above the 67th percentile in height (in centimeters). A $k-th$ percentile is a score at or below which a given percentage of a distribution $k$ falls.

**Answer:** Tall women are represented more in the data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
natality1<- natality %>%
  mutate(HT_CM = M_HT_IN * 2.54)

quant1=quantile(natality1$HT_CM, 0.33, na.rm = T)
quant3=quantile(natality1$HT_CM, 0.67, na.rm = T)

short_women<-natality1%>%
  filter(HT_CM<=quant1)%>%

tall_women<-natality1%>%
  filter(HT_CM>=quant3)%>%
  nrow(.)

short_women
